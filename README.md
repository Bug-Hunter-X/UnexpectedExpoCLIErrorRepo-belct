# Unexpected Expo CLI Error

This repository demonstrates a common but elusive issue with the Expo CLI where unexpected errors occur during the start or build process. The error message often lacks specificity, hindering quick resolution.

## Problem
The core problem stems from a combination of factors, including:

* **Version Mismatch:** An incompatibility between the Expo CLI version and the project dependencies (React Native, Expo SDK).
* **Corrupted Installation:** An incomplete or compromised installation of the Expo CLI.
* **Conflicting Packages/Configuration:** Interference from other packages or incorrect project configuration settings.

## Solution
The solution involves several steps designed to identify and address the root cause:

1. **Verify Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible version with your project's dependencies.  Upgrade or downgrade as needed.
2. **Clean Installation:** Completely remove and reinstall the Expo CLI to address potential corruption.
3. **Check Package.json:** Carefully examine your `package.json` for dependency conflicts or outdated packages. Resolve or update them.
4. **Clear Cache:** Remove Expo's cache to eliminate potential interference.
5. **Verify Project Setup:** Double-check your project's configuration to ensure there are no unusual or conflicting settings.
